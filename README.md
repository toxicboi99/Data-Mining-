Data Preprocessing

1.1 Data Cleaning

Definition: Process of detecting and correcting errors, missing values, and inconsistencies in data.

Techniques:

Handling missing values (mean/median/mode).

Removing duplicates.

Fixing inconsistent data entries.


Advantages: Improves accuracy, reduces errors.

Disadvantages: Time-consuming, possible data loss.

Example: Replacing missing ages with the average age of the dataset.


1.2 Data Integration and Transformation

Definition: Combining data from multiple sources and converting it into a suitable format.

Techniques: Merging databases, standardizing formats (e.g., dates).

Advantages: Better consistency, improved analysis.

Disadvantages: May cause redundancy, requires extra storage.

Example: Merging customer data from multiple branches.


1.3 Data Reduction

Definition: Reducing dataset size while maintaining key information.

Techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), data compression.

Advantages: Saves storage, speeds up processing.

Disadvantages: Risk of losing useful data, complex to implement.

Example: Selecting only important features from a dataset.


1.4 Discretization and Concept of Hierarchy Generation

Definition: Converting continuous data into discrete values and organizing data into levels.

Techniques: Interval-based grouping, hierarchical structuring.

Advantages: Easier analysis, lower computational complexity.

Disadvantages: May lose precision, requires proper selection.

Example: Categorizing age groups as Young (18-30), Middle-aged (31-50), and Senior (51+).


1.5 Task-Relevant Data

Definition: Selecting only the data required for a specific task.

Example: Analyzing customer purchase history instead of all customer details.


1.6 Background Knowledge

Definition: Using prior information to enhance data analysis.

Example: Using medical knowledge to classify patient records.


1.7 Presentation and Visualization of Discovered Patterns

Definition: Presenting data insights using graphs, charts, and tables.

Example: A bar chart showing monthly sales trends.

Data Mining Algorithms

2.1 Association Rule Mining

Definition: Finds relationships between items in a dataset.

Techniques: Apriori Algorithm, frequent itemsets.

Advantages: Useful for market basket analysis, recommendation systems.

Disadvantages: Can generate too many rules, needs large datasets.

Example: Customers who buy bread and butter also buy milk.


2.2 Classification and Prediction

Definition: Classification assigns labels, prediction estimates future values.

Example: Email spam detection (spam/not spam).


2.3 Decision Tree

Definition: A tree-like structure for decision-making.

Working: Splits data based on conditions.

Advantages: Easy to understand, handles numerical/categorical data.

Disadvantages: Can be complex, prone to overfitting.

Example: Predicting student pass/fail based on attendance and study hours.


2.4 Bayesian Classification

Definition: Uses probability and Bayes' theorem.

Advantages: Works with small datasets, fast computation.

Disadvantages: Assumes independence, unsuitable for complex data.

Example: Spam email detection using Naïve Bayes classifier.


2.5 Back Propagation

Definition: A training method for neural networks.

Advantages: Improves accuracy over time, useful in deep learning.

Disadvantages: Needs large datasets, slow training.

Example: Image recognition in AI.


2.6 Cluster Analysis

Definition: Groups similar data points together.

Techniques: K-Means, DBSCAN.

Advantages: Helps find patterns, useful in customer segmentation.

Disadvantages: Needs correct number of clusters, sensitive to outliers.

Example: Grouping customers based on purchase behavior.


2.7 Outlier Analysis

Definition: Identifies unusual data points.

Example: Detecting fraudulent transactions in a bank.
